# ICO tracking cycle for Radar

## About

This document describes a revised approach to tracking blockchain systems through different stages of their life cycle as applied by [cyber·Fund Radar](https://cyber.fund/radar). More specifically, it describes a reviewed procedure of listing new systems on Radar and following up their further development there. The document contains a methodology note and a step-by-step guide to be used by cyber·Fund. The final purpose of the document is to optimize the way cyber·Fund processes the incoming flow of new blockchain systems.

## Methodology
### Classification of blockchain systems 
In order to be listed on Radar, each new blockchain system will initially be located in one of the two following groups.

#### Group 1: "Starred" / "Pinned"

* _Description._ Systems that initially demonstrate a clear or at least some potential to deliver an interesting and valuable product worth investing into.
* _Selection criteria._ The indicator used to define the system’s initial potential will be the quality of a whitepaper or of a Proof of Concept code. A system should also comply with the following minimal requirements: a published whitepaper or a Proof of Concept code, open source code policy, autonomous decentralized system on blockchain with economic incentives introduced via a token.
* _Work approach._ By the end of the Radar tracking cycle, a system should be very well verified. As to systems that raise some concerns initially, cyber·Fund will follow up their development and can re-evaluate their potential later. As part of the verification process, an ICO report will be prepared on each system planning to raise funds via ICO. The report will be published on [cyber·Blog](https://blog.cyber.fund/Cyber.Blog). Projects that look most promising for investors will be granted more attention in a report. The projects from this Group should be handled on a first priority basis.

#### Group 2: "Purgatory" / "Laundry" 

* _Description._ All other projects that do not comply with the Group 1 selection criteria belong her. Those are systems that raise significant concerns, or their potential is not clear. 
* _Selection criteria._ A system should meet the formal selection criteria only: it should have a project name, headline, logo, website, whitepaper/ Proof of Concept code, and plan to issue a token.
* _Work approach._ Group 2 systems will be listed in a separate section on Radar and will be open to a verification by the community by voting them up or down. Group 2 systems will be processed by cyber·Fund on a second priority basis.

### Tracking cycle
A Radar tracking cycle consists of five stages divided by a type of a triggering event:

1. PoC code or WP is released
2. ICO date is announced 
3. ICO starts
4. ICO ends
5. Token is listed on exchanges

The stages can easily be renamed later keeping the underlying logic intact. 

below the cyber·Fund work flow is laid out per stage including a source of updates (how do we know that a triggering event happened) and required actions (what should cyber·Fund undertake given a triggering event happened). 

#### Stage 1. PoC code or WP is released

**Source of information**
* Ad hoc updates from web (blogs, Twitter, online news media, etc.)
* Ad hoc external input, e.g. from Satoshi.Fund team
* Project’s request on cyber•Fund or cybernator

**Required actions**

Group 1
* Subscribe to the project’s RSS to track ICO related announcements; if not available - alert the team and subscribe to e-mail announcements
* Add to chaingear which automatically places a system under “Anticipated” ICOs

Group 2:
* Subscribe to the project’s RSS to track ICO related announcements; if not available - alert the team and subscribe to Twitter and e-mail announcements
* Add to chaingear under the section “Purgatory” (not yet available)

#### Stage 2. ICO date announced

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS/e-mail/Twitter

**Required actions**

Group 1
* Tweet about the ICO announcement 
* Update chaingear with new data (a system is then removed to “Upcoming” ICOs)
* Prepare a short/detailed report for cyber•Blog
* Distribute the report ASAP via all communication channels
* Follow-up comments to the publication on cyber•Blog

Group 2
Re-evaluate a system and choose one of the three options:
 * Remove to Group 1 and follow the actions for Group 1 systems described above
 * Leave in Group 2 (Purgatory) and update chaingear with new data
 * If a scam - Leave in Group 2 (Purgatory), update chaingear with new data, add a scam alert to chaingear (not yet available), and tweet a scam alert

#### Stage 3. ICO starts

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS/e-mail/Twitter

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Tweet ASAP about the start of ICO
* Update chaingear (a system is then removed to "Ongoing" ICOs) 

Group 2
* Update chaingear with new data (automatically removes the system to "Ongoing" ICOs) 

#### Stage 4. ICO closes

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS/e-mail/Twitter

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Tweet ASAP about the end of ICO
* Update ASAP the ICO end date on chaingear (a system is then removed to "Successful" ICOs) 
* Update other post-ICO data on chaingear

Group 2
* Update the ICO end date on chaingear (automatically removes the system to "Successful" ICOs) 
* Update other post-ICO data on chaingear

#### Stage 5. Token is listed on exchanges

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS/e-mail/Twitter

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Tweet about the start of listing
* Follow-up in weekly overview on cyber•Blog

Group 2
R.I.P. until the community upvotes a system allowing to replace it post factum from Purgatory to "Successful" ICOs (the exact migration criteria and mechanism needs to be defined yet)
