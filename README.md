# ICO tracking cycle for Radar

## About

This document describes a revised approach to tracking blockchain systems through different stages of their life cycle as applied by [cyber·Fund Radar] (https://cyber.fund/radar). More specifically, it describes a reviewed procedure of listing new systems on Radar and following up their further development there. The document contains a methodology note and a step-by-step guide to be used by cyber·Fund. The final purpose of the document is to optimize the way cyber·Fund processes the incoming flow of new blockchain systems.

## Methodology
### Classification of blockchain systems 
In order to be listed on Radar, each new blockchain system will initially be located in one of the two following groups.

#### Group 1: "Starred" / "Pinned"

* _Description._ Systems that initially demonstrate a clear or at least some potential to deliver an interesting and valuable product worth investing into.
* _Selection criteria._ The indicator used to define the system’s initial potential will be the quality of a whitepaper or of a Proof of Concept code. A system should also comply with the following minimal requirements: a published whitepaper or a Proof of Concept code, open source code policy, autonomous decentralized system on blockchain with economic incentives introduced via a token.
* _Work approach._ By the end of the Radar tracking cycle, a system should be very well verified. As to systems that raise some concerns initially, cyber·Fund will follow up their development and can re-evaluate their potential later. As part of the verification process, an ICO report will be prepared on each system planning to raise funds via ICO. The report will be published on [cyber·Blog] (https://blog.cyber.fund/Cyber.Blog). Projects that look most promising for investors will be granted more attention in a report. The projects from this Group should be handled on a first priority basis.

### Group 2: "Purgatory" / "Laundry" 

* _Description._ All other projects that do not comply with the Group 1 selection criteria belong her. Those are systems that raise significant concerns, or their potential is not clear. 
* _Selection criteria._ A system should meet the formal selection criteria only: it should have a project name, headline, logo, website, whitepaper/ Proof of Concept code, and plan to issue a token.
* _Work approach._ Group 2 systems will be listed in a separate section on Radar and will be open to a verification by the community by voting them up or down. Group 2 systems will be processed by cyber·Fund on a second priority basis.

### Tracking cycle
The tracking cycle consists of five stages defined by a triggering event. Those stages may later be renamed if deemed necessary, but the differentiation logic remains the same.  

1. PoC code or WP is released
2. ICO date announced 
3. ICO starts
4. ICO ends
5. Listed on exchanges

Per each stage we will lay out the work process by Cyber.Fund team into the following categories: a source of updates (where the team gets to know that a triggering event happened) and required actions (what actions Cyber.Fund team should undertake to maintain the tracking process). 

#### Stage 1. PoC code or WP is released

**Source of information**
* Ad hoc updates from web (blogs, Twitter, etc.)
* Ad hoc external advice, e.g. from Satoshi.Fund team
* Project’s request on cyber•Fund or cybernator

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Subscribe to the project’s RSS to track ICO related announcements
* Add to chaingear under the section “Anticipated”

Group 2:
* Subscribe to the project’s RSS to track ICO related announcements
* Add to chaingear under the section “Purgatory” (not yet available)

#### Stage 2. ICO date announced

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS

**Required actions**

Group 1
* Update chaingear (automatically removed to “Upcoming” ICOs)
* Tweet
* Prepare a short/detailed report for Cyber.blog
* Distribute the report ASAP via all communication channels
* Follow-up comments to the publication on Cyber.Blog

Group 2
Re-evaluate and choose one of the three options:
 * Leave in Group 2 (Purgatory)
 * Remove to Group 1 and follow the actions applicable to Group 1
 * Add a scam alert to chaingear (not yet available) and tweet a scam alert

#### Stage 3. ICO starts

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Tweet ASAP about main results
* Update chaingear (automatically removes the system to "Ongoing" ICOs) 

Group 2
* Update chaingear (automatically removes the system to "Ongoing" ICOs) 

#### Stage 4. ICO closes

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Tweet ASAP about the end of ICO
* Update ASAP the ICO end date on chaingear (automatically removes the system to "Successful" ICOs) 
* Update other post-ICO data on chaingear

Group 2
* Update ASAP the ICO end date on chaingear (automatically removes the system to "Successful" ICOs) 
* Update other post-ICO data on chaingear

#### Stage 5. Listed on exchanges

**Source of information**
* Project’s updates via RSS

**Required actions**
Group 1
* Tweet
* Follow-up in weekly overview in Cyber.blog

Group 2
R.I.P.
