# ICO tracking cycle for Radar

## About

This document describes the methodology of tracking blockchain systems through different stages of their life cycle, used by Cyber.Fund Radar. The purpose of the document is to revise the current process of tracking blockchain systems that is reflected in Cyber.Fund Content Factory and consequently revise the architecture of Cyber.Fund Radar.   

## Methodology
### Classification of blockchain systems 
In order to be listed on Radar, each new blockchain system will initially be located in one of the two following groups.

#### Group 1: "Starred" 

* _Description._ Systems that demonstrate a clear or at least some initial potential to deliver an interesting and valuable product.
* _Selection criteria._ The indicator used to define the system’s initial potential will be the quality of the whitepaper or a Proof of Concept code. All systems in this group should also comply with the following minimal requirements: a published whitepaper or a Proof of Concept code, open source code policy, autonomous decentralized system on blockchain with economic incentives introduced via a token.
* _Work approach._ By the end of the Radar tracking cycle, all systems should be very well verified. As to the projects that look interesting but raise some concerns initially, we will follow up their development and can re-evaluate their potential later. An ICO report will be prepared per each system launching an ICO as part of the verification process and will be published on Cyber.Blog. Projects that look most interesting to invest in will be reviewed in most detail in an ICO report. 

#### Group 2: "Purgatory"

* _Description._ All other projects that do not comply with the Group 1 selection criteria. These systems raise significant concerns or their potential is not clear yet. 
* _Selection criteria._ To be placed in this Group and be listed on Radar, a system should meet the formal selection criteria only: it should have a project name, headline, logo, website, whitepaper or Proof of Concept code, and a token.
* _Work approach._ These systems will be listed in a separate section on Radar (code name - Purgatory) and will be subject to the verification by the community by voting them up or down. 

### Tracking cycle
The tracking cycle consists of five stages defined by a triggering event. Those stages may later be renamed if deemed necessary, but the differentiation logic remains the same.  

1. PoC code or WP is released
2. ICO date announced 
3. ICO starts
4. ICO ends
5. Listed on exchanges

Per each stage we will lay out the work process by Cyber.Fund team into the following categories: a source of updates (where the team gets to know that a triggering event happened) and required actions (what actions Cyber.Fund team should undertake to maintain the tracking process). 

**Stage 1. PoC code or WP is released**

Source of information

* Ad hoc updates from web (blogs, Twitter, etc.)
* Ad hoc external advice, e.g. from Satoshi.Fund team
* Project’s request on cyber•Fund or cybernator

Required actions
* Groups 1 and 2: Subscribe to the project’s RSS to track ICO related announcements; add RSS to chaingear.
* Group 1: Add to chaingear under the section “Anticipated”
* Group 2: Add to chaingear under the section “Purgatory” (not yet available)

**Stage 2. ICO date announced**

Source of information

* Project’s updates received via RSS subscription

Required actions

Group 1:
* Update chaingear removing the project under the section “Upcoming ICOs”
* Tweet
* Prepare a short/detailed report for Cyber.blog
* Distribute the report ASAP via all communication channels
* Follow-up comments to the publication on Cyber.Blog

Group 2:

Re-evaluate and choose one of the three options:

 * Leave in Group 2 (Purgatory)
 * Remove to Group 1 and follow the actions applicable to Group 1
 * Add a scam alert to chaingear (not yet available) and tweet
